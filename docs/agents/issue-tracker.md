# Issue tracker: Local Markdown (docs/tickets)

Issues and specs (you may know a spec as a PRD) for this repo live as markdown files in
`docs/tickets/` — alongside `docs/design/` and `docs/plans/`, not in a `.scratch/`
directory (this repo keeps its planning artifacts under version control, not in a
gitignored scratch area).

## Conventions

- One feature per directory: `docs/tickets/<feature-slug>/`
- The spec is `docs/tickets/<feature-slug>/spec.md` (when a spec exists — this repo
  usually specs work via `docs/plans/story-N-*.md` instead; see
  [docs/agents/domain.md](domain.md))
- Implementation issues are one file per ticket at
  `docs/tickets/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01` in dependency
  order (blockers first) — never a single combined tickets file
- Triage state is recorded as a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file (see
  [triage-labels.md](triage-labels.md) for the role strings)
- Comments and conversation history append to the bottom of the file under a
  `## Comments` heading

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a new file under `docs/tickets/<feature-slug>/issues/` (creating the directory if
needed).

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read the file at the referenced path. The user will normally pass the path or the issue
number directly.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a file with one **child** file per ticket.

- **Map**: `docs/tickets/<effort>/map.md` — the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body.
- **Child ticket**: `docs/tickets/<effort>/issues/NN-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, with
  the question in the body. A `Type:` line records the ticket type
  (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`); a `Status:` line records
  `claimed`/`resolved`.
- **Blocking**: a `Blocked by: NN, NN` line near the top. A ticket is unblocked when every
  file it lists is `resolved`.
- **Frontier**: scan `docs/tickets/<effort>/issues/` for files that are open, unblocked,
  and unclaimed; first by number wins.
- **Claim**: set `Status: claimed` and save before any work.
- **Resolve**: append the answer under an `## Answer` heading, set `Status: resolved`,
  then append a context pointer (gist + link) to the map's Decisions-so-far in `map.md`.
